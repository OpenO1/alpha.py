# Alpha, AlphaZero
Alpha or AlphaZero is a useful Python module for maths, physics, chemistry and more.

# Start using Alpha, AlphaZero
* ⚠️ Alpha modules aren't available to download via `pip install alpha.py / alphazero.py` due to the project still in work in progress.
To start using the beta version of those modules, just download the `alpha.py` or `alphazero.py` file, put in the same location as your code file and just import with
`import alpha` or `import alphazero`

# Example
```py
import alphazero as az
console = az.console

alpha = az.p2.alpha(a, b)
beta = az.p2.beta(a, b, c)

console.write(f"Alpha: {alpha} | Beta: {beta}")


```

# How do I get the informations about the alpha files that I have downloaded ?
* In your program or in another python file write this:
```py
import pkgch
pkgch.c(True)

# output:
# ID
# VERSION
# NAME
# LANGUAGE
#ID: status
#Version: status
#Module: status
#Language: status
```
If one of this is "Incorrect." please re-download the alpha files and check them again.
